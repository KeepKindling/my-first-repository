# My very first website

Welcome! [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## What is this website for?

I have created this website to portray my beginnings of my journey through code and the code-institute course. It also shows off some basic knowledge of html and css. 

## How i feel about coding so far?

After following the lessons for a month, I'm starting to get a feel for how code works and how the principles make applying my knowledge to my work simpler. I'm getting the hang of it but I do still feel very immature and intimidated by a lot of the lessons, so I try to reflect on past lessons quickly to refresh my memory.

## What has helped me?

I attempted a hackathon as everybody suggested it, especially to new students as they have lots to learn. But honestly I felt really out-of-place so I didnt really contributed much. But it gave me an idea into what its like and being part of a team which is a plus. Also the students and tutors of code institute. Discussing problems with them on slack make me feel really comfortable with my mistakes. Although I'm yet to start a project, My mentor will give me great insight and will be irreplacable as i progress throught this course.

### What are my plans going forward for projects and general practice?

1. Will keep a note of any and all idea's for future project's
2. Will look up other developers project's from linkedin to gain a good perspective on what to expect and good practice's
3. Keep returning to old lesson's to solidify my confidence with principle's in HTML and CSS
4. Discuss with other student's to keep morale up and hold good connection's with other's 
4. Will have fun while doing it!
